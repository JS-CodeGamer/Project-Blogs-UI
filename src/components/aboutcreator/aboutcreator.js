                Hey, there, Jagteshver here. To be honest I was feeling kinda down lately,
                due to some personal reasons. So, I decided to created a personal Journal website,
                to write some of my Thoughts in. Which eventually extended to this website here
                whose sole publishing the thoughts of any user (I added in user management as bonus).
